# asian-critics-choice
This is a project for Columbia Journalism School. I scraped BBC's definitive list of "The 21st Century's Greatest Films" using BeautifulSoup. I cleaned the data, narrowed it down to movies chosen by critics in Asian countries, and then scraped IMDb using Playwright for the birthplaces of each movie's director.
